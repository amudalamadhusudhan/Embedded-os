# Embedded OS Assignment

## Day 1

- 2 Tier and 3 Tier Embedded Systems

  - CPU
    - PC/ IP
    - GPRs
    - Flags
    - Stack Pointer (SP)
  - Memory
    - Code
    - Data
  - Peripheral
- Bare Metal Systems
- SP, SF, Stack
  - SP - Register inside a CPU -> pointing to the top of stack
  - Stack - Chunk of memory
  - SF - Frame created on the Stack when you call a function. Deleted when you return from the function
- Frame Pointer - points to the base of the frame
- How are arguments passed to the function
  - Stack
  - Registers

    - Group ID
    - Group Name
    - Group Members

- Superuser

## Day 4

- Library

  - Static Libraries
    - .a
  - Dynamic Libraries aka Shared Object Libraries

    - Windows => .dll
    - Linux => .so

  - Standard Library
    - GCC -> libc.a / libc.so
    - Bundled as part of the compiler /toolchain
    - ANSI
    - eg. printf, strcpy, strlen, scanf, fopen
  - User Library/ Third Party Library
    - App Developer
    - eg. Your own arith functionality, mp3 decoding library

- Archive command to create and extract libraries

  - ar crv
  - ar x

- Assignment (Both: Static and Shared Object):

  - Repeat the demo shown in the class
  - Enhance the library to add mul and div functions
  - Update the library and send it to your friend to use it

- Syscalls

  - open, write and close
  - File Descriptors (fd)
  - Assignment: 1
    - Create a file
    - Write to the file
    - Close the file
  - Assignment: 2
    - Create a file
    - Read from the file
    - Print it on screen
    - Close the file
  - Explore
    - Return values for read and write system calls

## Day 5

- CPU (Uniprocessor)

  - Physical Hardware => PC, SP, GPR, Flags

- One CPU -> One Process at any given instance
- One CPU => Multiple process

- Memory

  - Each process given a separate address space
  - Address space is divided into 2 parts:
    - Text
    - Data
    - BSS
    - Heap
    - Stack

- Context

  - Contents of the registers PC, SP, GPR, Flags
  - Context Saving
    - Physical registers to Logical Copy (in memory)
  - Context Restoring

  - New
  - Ready
  - Running
  - Waiting/ Blocked
  - Terminated/ Exit
