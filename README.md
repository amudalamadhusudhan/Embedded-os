    - Write to the file
    - Close the file
  - Assignment: 2

## Day 5

- CPU (Uniprocessor)

  - Physical Hardware => PC, SP, GPR, Flags

- One CPU -> One Process at any given instance
- One CPU => Multiple process

    - Data is Sequential
    - open, read, wirte, close

# Assignment

1. Write your own utility using system calls (open, read, write, close) to copy data from one file to another file. Essentially you are implementing a copy utility. Fullfledged utility should support the following options:

- Handling all the errors
- cp srcfile destfile

2. Write your own utility using library calls (fopen, fread, fwrite, fclose) to copy data from one file to another file. Essentially you are implementing a copy utility. Fullfledged utility should support the following options:

- Handling all the errors
- cp srcfile destfile

3. Research

- Which of the following programs took more time to copy file
  1. Small
  2. Medium
  3. Large
- Justify your results => Why does system call / library call take time to copy file.

# Day 8

- POSIX Threads

  - pthread_create
  - pthread_join

    - Heap
  - Threads do not share the following sections with Process
    - Stack
    - means that each threads has its own stack
