## Day 4

- Library

  - Static Libraries
    - .a
  - Dynamic Libraries aka Shared Object Libraries

    - Windows => .dll
    - Linux => .so

  - Standard Library
    - GCC -> libc.a / libc.so
    - Bundled as part of the compiler /toolchain
    - ANSI
    - eg. printf, strcpy, strlen, scanf, fopen
  - User Library/ Third Party Library
    - App Developer
    - eg. Your own arith functionality, mp3 decoding library

- Archive command to create and extract libraries

  - ar crv
  - ar x

- Assignment (Both: Static and Shared Object):

  - Repeat the demo shown in the class
  - Enhance the library to add mul and div functions
  - Update the library and send it to your friend to use it

- Syscalls

  - open, write and close
  - File Descriptors (fd)
  - Assignment: 1
    - Create a file
    - Write to the file
    - Close the file
  - Assignment: 2
    - Create a file
    - Read from the file
    - Print it on screen
    - Close the file
  - Explore
    - Return values for read and write system calls

## Day 5

- CPU (Uniprocessor)

  - Physical Hardware => PC, SP, GPR, Flags

- One CPU -> One Process at any given instance
- One CPU => Multiple process

- Memory

  - Each process given a separate address space
  - Address space is divided into 2 parts:
    - Text
    - Data
    - BSS

# Assignment

1. Write your own utility using system calls (open, read, write, close) to copy data from one file to another file. Essentially you are implementing a copy utility. Fullfledged utility should support the following options:

- Handling all the errors
- cp srcfile destfile

2. Write your own utility using library calls (fopen, fread, fwrite, fclose) to copy data from one file to another file. Essentially you are implementing a copy utility. Fullfledged utility should support the following options:

- Handling all the errors
- cp srcfile destfile

3. Research

- Which of the following programs took more time to copy file
  1. Small
  2. Medium
  3. Large
- Justify your results => Why does system call / library call take time to copy file.
